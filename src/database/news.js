Tank wasn’t the only hero, even the other family dog, a pit bull, notices it and even if he’s smaller tonnage he doesn’t get scared and runs to the rescue. Then the maverick’s owner notices it and retrieves it and the child’s mother also comes running and takes him away with her.`,

    description: `Many already know that chocolate and cocoa are toxic to dogs. In fact, they contain substances such as theobromine and caffeine that dogs cannot synthesize. Dark chocolate contains even more than milk chocolate. The consequences could be vomiting and diarrhea, but in the most serious cases they could even have convulsions and severe shock. Another food to absolutely avoid is grapes or raisins. The symptoms of intoxication manifest themselves much later than the intake. It often takes 48 hours to 5 days. But they can lead to states of suffering, such as vomiting and absence of urine, up to tremor and in some serious cases kidney failure. This could in turn become lethal for the dog.

Several other plant products are toxic in various ways. They range from cauliflower, capable of causing intestinal problems, to onion and garlic. In the latter two cases, the precaution must be maximum, as far as it is related to the quantity ingested. In the case of garlic, the symptoms are almost immediate and evident. In the case of the onion, on the other hand, we may not notice it in the early hours. Still, the consequences could be very serious. Garlic could cause anemia. The onion, on the other hand, anorexia, depression and accelerated beats. Among the fruit, even the avocado, in all its parts, could cause serious breathing difficulties for the dog.

Even if dry, fruit could be dangerous. Nuts, especially black nuts and macadamia nuts, can be very toxic and cause fever and diarrhea. Instead we should be careful with pistachios, peanuts and almonds for the risk of potential choking.

Absolute danger to dogs who eat not only chocolate and sugars but also these common foods

Returning to the more generic and well-known categories, foods containing sugars could lead to diabetes in dogs. Alcohol and caffeine, as imaginable, are really dangerous. The body of our four-legged friends is unable to metabolize alcohol. Hops can even cause respiratory damage. On the other hand, caffeine heavily alters the heart rhythm. Foods that are too salty will cause problems if minimum quantities are exceeded. These range from the common need to drink with associated urination, up to episodes of convulsions, in case of large quantities. Milk and its derivatives will cause gastrointestinal problems. These could also lead to pancreatitis. Spices will be variously toxic. Finally, the bones could break and puncture the animal’s lungs.

If we realize that the dog has eaten these foods, we may call the vet. These, depending on the indications, could suggest that we induce vomiting in the dog.`,
